## Scheme

- Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism
- Interfaces and method overriding
- Data Structures, Array, Stacks & Queue
- Generics- Lists, sets, maps
- Java swing library - File writer
- Exception handling
- Streams API

## Notes

- String (Object/Reference type)
- Primitive types hold the byte value you want to store

Method overloading - methods with the same name but different parameters/signatures
Interface is a collection of abstract methods(methods with no body).
Classes automatically inherit from the object class.
Array is a homogenous collection of elements.

Dont remove an item from empty stack - Insert at top of the stack - Remove from the top - Dont insert into a full stack
Adding an item into a stack is "push"
Removing is to pop.
